- Went to HIVE with Cat and poked around to find components.
- There are battery holders and batteries, BUT you cannot take
  the battery holders out of the facility.
- There are multicolored LEDs and SPST switches.

- Multicolored LEDs specify forward voltage and current.
- Researched battery holders. Can find 5-pc battery holders (each holder holds 2 AA batteries for 3V) for about $8
